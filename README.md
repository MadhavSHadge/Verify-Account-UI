# Verify Account UI

## Description
This project is a simple and user-friendly UI for verifying an account by entering a six-digit OTP code. The interface is clean and responsive, designed for seamless user interaction. The UI includes:

- A container with instructions for entering the OTP.
- Six input fields for each digit of the OTP.
- Placeholder and validation for numerical input.
- A message explaining that this is a design-only implementation.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Numerical Validation**: Ensures only numbers can be entered in the input fields.
- **Clear Instructions**: Helps users understand the OTP entry process.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the page.
- `style.css`: Defines the styling for the UI elements (not included in the current upload but expected).
- `script.js`: Adds interactivity, such as focusing on the next input field after entering a digit (not included in the current upload but expected).

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. The page will display a form to input a six-digit OTP.
3. Users can enter one digit per field.
4. A message below the input fields explains the mock design.

## How to Extend
- **Add Backend Support**: Integrate with a server to send and validate OTPs.
- **Enhance Interactivity**: Use `script.js` to automatically move the cursor to the next input field after a digit is entered.
- **Styling Enhancements**: Update `style.css` to match your brandâ€™s theme.

## Requirements
- A web browser to view the project.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for modifications.

## Limitations
- The project is currently front-end only and does not send or verify actual OTPs.
- Requires additional backend implementation for complete functionality.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this project and enhance it! Contributions such as improved styling, interactivity, or backend integration are welcome.
